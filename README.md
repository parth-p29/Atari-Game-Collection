# Python-Games

Hello Everyone!

These are the games I made with Python, using the Pygame library. I developed skills such as object orientated programming, inheritance, problem-solving etc. when creating these projects and became proficient with Python. I also taught students how to build some of these games, during my time as an Exec Teacher in my School's CS Club.

Things you will need for these games:

a) Have Python (any version is fine) downloaded

b) pip install pygame - which downloads the pygame library into your environment


Project 1: Color Pong!

This is a variation of classic 90s game - Pong. The slight twist I added in my version is a new game mechanic where the player has to match the color of the paddle with that of the ball. The ball's color changes whenever it collides with yours or the computer's paddle. It varies between 3 different colors and your paddle has to match the changed color for you to stay in the game! You have to face off against the computer and see how many points you can stack up. Have fun trying it out!
