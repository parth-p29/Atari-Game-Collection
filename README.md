Python-Games - Atari Game Collection

Hello Everyone!

These are the games I made with Python, using the Pygame library. I developed skills such as object orientated programming, inheritance, problem-solving etc. when creating these projects and became proficient with Python. I also taught students how to build some of these games, during my time as an Exec Teacher in my School's CS Club.

Things you will need for these games:

a) Have Python (any version is fine) downloaded

b) pip install pygame - which downloads the pygame library into your environment

Project 1: Color Pong!

This is a variation of classic 90s game - Pong. The slight twist I added in my version is a new game mechanic where the player has to match the color of the paddle with that of the ball. The ball's color changes whenever it collides with yours or the computer's paddle. It varies between 3 different colors and your paddle has to match the changed color for you to stay in the game! You have to face off against the computer and see how many points you can stack up. Have fun trying it out!


Project 2: Space Invaders

I developed the classic Space Invaders game in which you control a spaceship and shoot lasers to destroy incoming alien battleships. There are multiples of waves of enemies that the player has to defeat and the aliens can shoot back at you too! Every enemy that you don't kill by the time they pass by, you lose 5% of your overall health. You have 3 lives in total and once you loose all three of them its game over. Enjoy! Some concepts I used to make this game include: Object Orientated Programming - classes and inheritance.


Project 3: Snake Game

I developed the classic Snake game in which the player controls a snake that grows whenever it eats the 'food.' If the player makes the snake run into itself the game is over. In this project I also added a lot of sprites to make the game look more pleasant than just a ball in a black background. I hope you enjoy playing this classic game!
